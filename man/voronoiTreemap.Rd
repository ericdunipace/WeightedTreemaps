\arguments{
\item{data}{(data.frame) A data.frame with one column for each hierarchical level}

\item{levels}{(character) Character vector indicating the column names to 
be used. The order of names must correspond to the hierarchical levels, 
going from broad to fine}

\item{fun}{(function) Function to be used to aggregate cell sizes of parental cells}

\item{sort}{(logical) Should the columns of the data.frame be sorted before treemap generation?}

\item{filter}{(numeric) Filter the supplied data frame to remove very small
cells that may not be visible. The default is to remove cells with a 
relative target area below a threshold of zero (no negative values allowed). 
Computation time can increase when many small cells are present. For example, 
a threshold of 0.01 filters out all observations/cells below 1 \% of the total area.}

\item{cell_size}{(character) The name of the column used to control cell size. 
Can be one of \code{levels} or any other column with numerical data. NA or
values equal or less than zero are not allowed as the cell area needs to be positive.
The values in this column are aggregated by the function specified by \code{fun}.
If \code{cell_size = NULL}, cell area is simply computed by the number of members
for the respective cell (corresponding to rows in the data.frame).}

\item{custom_color}{(character) An optional column that can be specified to
control cell color. Cell colors are determined when drawing the treemap
using \code{\link{drawTreemap}}, but the default is to use one of 
\code{levels} or \code{cell size}. Any other data source that shall be used
instead has to be included in the treemap generation and explicitly 
specified here. The default value is \code{NULL}.}

\item{shape}{(list or character) Set the initial shape of the treemap. Currently
supported are the keywords "rectangle", "rounded_rect", "circle" or "hexagon".
Alternatively the user can supply a named list with coordinates for a custom polygon.
The slots of the list must be labeled 'x' and 'y'. The coordinates are not tested
for validity, use on your own risk.}

\item{maxIteration}{(numeric) Force algorithm to stop at this number of iterations
for each parent cell. The algorithm usually converges to an acceptable 
solution fairly quickly, so it seems reasonable to restrict this number
in order to save computation time. However, more iterations give higher
accuracy.}

\item{error_tol}{(numeric) The allowed maximum error tolerance of a cell.
The algorithm will stop when all cells have lower error than this value.
It is calculated as the absolute difference of a cell's area to its target
area. The default is 0.01 (or 1 \%) of the total parental area. Note: this
is is different from a relative per-cell error, where 1 \% would be more 
strict.}

\item{seed}{(integer) The default seed is NULL, which will lead to a new 
random sampling of cell coordinates for each tesselation. If you want
a reproducible arrangement of cells, set seed to an arbitrary number.}

\item{positioning}{(character) Algorithm for positioning of starting 
coordinates of child cells in the parental cell using \code{spsample()};
"random" for completely random positions, "regular" for cells aligned 
to a grid sorted from bottom to top by name, "clustered" with regular 
positions of cells but sorted by name from inside out. Two variants 
"regular_by_area" and "clustered_by_area" will work as their counterparts 
but will sort by cell target area instead of cell name. \code{positioning}
can be a single character or a vector of \code{length(levels)} to allow
different positioning algorithms for each level.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) If verbose is TRUE (default is FALSE), messages
with statistics for each iteration of a treemap as well as a success message
are printed to the console.}

\item{debug}{(logical) If debug is TRUE (default is FALSE), the solution 
for each iteration is drawn to the viewport to allow some visual 
inspection. The weights, target area, and difference are printed to the 
console. It is not recommended to set this option to TRUE unless you know
what you are doing, as it makes treemap generation much slower.}
}
\value{
`voronoiTreemap` returns an object of the formal class `voronoiResult`.
  It is essentially a list of objects related to the graphical
  representation of the treemap (polygons, labels, cell data) as well as data from the call
  of the function. It contains the following slots:
    \item{cells}{`list` of polygons for drawing a treemap}
    \item{data}{`data.frame`, the original data that was supplied to calling `voronoiTreemap`}
    \item{call}{`list` of arguments used to call `voronoiTreemap`}
}
\description{
Create nested additively weighted Voronoi treemaps.
}
\details{
This is a recursive wrapper function, making use of the original implementation 
of the voronoi tesselation from Paul Murrell, University of Auckland.
The original functions were obtained and slightly modified from
\url{https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/Reports/VoronoiTreemap/voronoiTreeMap.html}
This function returns a treemap object instead of a plot. In order 
to actually draw the treemap, use \code{\link{drawTreemap}}.
