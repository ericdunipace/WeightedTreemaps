Description: Treemaps are a visually appealing graphical representation of numerical data using a 
  space-filling approach. A plane or 'map' is subdivided into smaller areas called cells. 
  The cells in the map are scaled according to an underlying metric which allows to grasp the 
  hierarchical organization and relative importance of many objects at once. This package contains 
  two different implementations of treemaps, Voronoi treemaps and Sunburst treemaps. 
  The Voronoi treemap function subdivides the plot area in polygonal cells according to 
  the highest hierarchical level, then continues to subdivide those parental cells on the 
  next lower hierarchical level, and so on. The Sunburst treemap is a computationally less
  demanding treemap that does not require iterative refinement, but simply generates 
  circle sectors that are sized according to predefined weights.
  The Voronoi tesselation is based on functions from 
  Paul Murrell (2012) <https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/Reports/VoronoiTreemap/voronoiTreeMap.html>.
